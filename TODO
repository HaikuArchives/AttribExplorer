TODO for AttribExplorer

Tasks importance varies from "very high" to "very low".

GENERAL
- Clean up and comment the source code [high]
- Write the documentation [medium]
- Port to PowerPC [medium]
- Break out CodeWarrior by making a real Makefile (not very important, but it's the best for GPL software) [very low]

FUNCTIONALITY
- Rewrite Attribute and AttributeItem classes. If you want to do this, please speak with me, I'm studying the possibilities [very high]
- Create the editor! But please wait for the new classes [very high]
- Add basic edit functions like Rename, set type, set size, and so on [high]
- Add the ability to edit node info (like Tracker's "Get Info", but editable) [high]
- Implement endian swap for PowerPC-style attributes (partially done, only the "swap" part is missing) [medium]
- Add casting for more types of data [low]

INTERFACE
- Create a better list of the attributes, like the Santa's gif bag "ColumnListView" by Brian Tietz [low]
- Drag & drop files from Tracker [low]
- Create an icon! [low]

DELICATESSEN
- Rid out of the warning "use of 'l' length character with 'f' type character" when compiling AttributeItem.cpp [very low]
